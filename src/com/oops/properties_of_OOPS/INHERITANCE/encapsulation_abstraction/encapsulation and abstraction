ENCAPSULATION
1.public 2.private 3.protected 4.default(nomodifier)


public-accessible inside the class,package,and it can be accessible everywhere
private-it can be accessible in the same class only but,we can use getters and setters to get the value and set the value
for the private property
protected-it can be also accessible everywhere but we have extend the class where the protected member
has been declared.so in that in case it can be accessible every where
default(no modifier)-it can also e accessible everywhere but in the same package only.


when to use which one ?
private is used for sensitive data
public can be accessible every where for ex:PSVM can be accessible every where
protected can be accessible in all case for example when we need a property that cant be accessible in outside package
in different package
