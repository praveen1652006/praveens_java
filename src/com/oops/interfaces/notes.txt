Abstract classes:
1.cannot be able to create objects for the abstract class
2.can't able to abstract constructor and static methods
3.the constructors in the abstract classes are accessed by only derived classes
4. we cant set the abstract class as final because an abstract should be derived
to set the body
5.any class that contains 1 or more abstract methods the class should be declared as abstract
6.if I put final in the class before it prevents it from inherited.
7.it can have abstract methods and non-abstract methods also

Interfaces:
1.interfaces contains abstract functions that are public
(no (body) of the function is allowed in the interface).
2.the variables are static and final by default.
3.has no memory on the heap.
4.in interfaces implements keyword is used to extend multiple classes.
5.static interface methods should always have a body when it is declared
